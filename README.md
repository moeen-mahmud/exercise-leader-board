## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font styles
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For icons

### What I learned

This challenge seems to be easy but the layout positioning is little tricky. I struggled a bit to organize the cards. Though it is not pixel perfect but relatively same to the original. This is a great challenge and I enjoy a lot.

### Continued Development

I really enjoy the course and the coding challenges. I will do at least one landing page per day from now on.

### Useful resources
